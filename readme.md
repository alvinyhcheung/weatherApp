# Weather App

Checkout the App [here](http://hamiwood.duckdns.org:3000/)

Enter in a location and this web application will send an API request to [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and grab the longitude and latitude.

Upon receiving the geo-location, it will send another API request to [WeatherStack](https://weatherstack.com/) using those co-ordinates to fetch forecast data.
